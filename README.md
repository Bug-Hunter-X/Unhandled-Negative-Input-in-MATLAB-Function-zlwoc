This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error:  unhandled negative input. The function `myFunction` is designed to process non-negative inputs. If a negative input is provided, it throws a generic error, making debugging difficult. The `bugSolution.m` file shows how to improve error handling by providing more specific error messages and using try-catch blocks for better exception management.
